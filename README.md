# student's-marks-prediction
We have predicted student's marks using multi linear regression.
We considered student's previous grades as G1,G2 and study time,absences,failures in the sense number of backlogs student had before.
Based on the above we predicted G3 as student's marks.
You can download dataset and code which I have uploaded here and try to test in jupiter note book or any other environment.
